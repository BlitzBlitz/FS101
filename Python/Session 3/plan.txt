OOP -> Object Oriented Programming
    [is programming paradime -> a form of organizing our code into Classes]
Classes = attributes + actions
        = values + functions

Classes = new custom type
Object  = variable instanciated from the class

How we organise code?

    Variables
    Functions
    --------------------------------------->Functional Programming
    Classes
    --------------------------------------->OOP
    Package = A banch of Classes
    Library / Framework = A banch of Packages

Library -> A banch of Packages [no rules enforced]                          REACT
Framework -> A banch of Packages [rules enforced to do a certain thing]     ANGULAR, DJANGO

Classes vs Objects

    One Class -> Many Objects

Constructors
    Special methods that help to build the object

Inheritance 
    Child -> Parent relationship
    The Child will inherite all the attributes and actions of the Parent(Base)

Composition
    Puting objects inside other objects

Polymorphism
    Treating a child class as its parent class
