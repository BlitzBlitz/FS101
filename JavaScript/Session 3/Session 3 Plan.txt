3.  Exercises:
        1. Code a program to diplay:
            1 3 5 7 9 11 ... 
            ... 11 9 7 5 3 1
        2. Code a program to get the number of vowels in a string

        3. Code a program to delete all vowels of a string

        4. Code a program to get a number n and return the number
                123456789...
        5. (Average a Sequence of Integers) Write a program that calculates and prints the average of
            several integers. Assume the last value read with scanf is the sentinel -1. A typical input sequence
            might be
        6. Write a program that finds the smallest of several integers of ex5.

        7.The factorial function is used frequently in probability problems. The factorial of
            a positive integer n (written n! and pronounced “n factorial”) is equal to the product of the positive
            integers from 1 to n. Write a program that evaluates the factorials of the integers from 1 to 5. Print the
            results in tabular format. What difficulty might prevent you from calculating the factorial of 20?
        8.(Calculating the Value of π) Calculate the value of π from the infinite series  4- 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9
            Print a table that shows the value of π approximated by one term of this series, by two terms, by
            three terms, and so on. How many terms of this series do you have to use before you first get 3.14?
            3.141? 3.1415? 3.14159?

        9.Write a program that prints a table of all
            the Roman numeral equivalents of the decimal numbers in the range 1 to 100.
        10. Write a program to display the floors of a building and for each floor it should 
                display the app #. Take the number of floors and the number of app/floor as input
        11. Write a program to count the number of vowels in a set of strings given by the Usercases
                At the end of the set the user should eneter the word "quit"
        12. Write a program to count the average letter/word in a set of words a user enters
                At the end of the set the user should eneter the word "quit"
