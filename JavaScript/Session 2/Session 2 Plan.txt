    Between programming and problem solving

1. Building conditions and using if statments
    a. Build conditions using the Comparision (<,>,<=,>=, ==, !=, ===, !==)
    b. We use the conditions inside the if statment
    c. We can combined more than one condition using logical operators(&&, ||, !)
        true && true => true
        true && false => false
        false && true => false
        false && false => false

        true || true => true
        true || false => true
        false || true => true
        false || false => false

1.5 If statment
        a. it has 3 parts if-keyword, condition, body
        b. it will only execute if the condition is true
        c. it may have an else part 
                which will only execute if the conditionis false



2.  Exercises:
        A.
            (Arithmetic) Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, obtains them from
            the user and prints their sum, product, difference, quotient and remainder.

            Write a program that reads in the radius
            of a circle and prints the circle’s diameter, circumference and area. Use the constant value 3.14159
            for π.

            Write a program that inputs one five-digit number, separates the number into its individual digits and prints the digits separated from one another by three
            spaces each.

            Write a program to swap the values of two varaibles

            Create a BMI calculator application that reads the user’s weight in pounds and height in inches

            Write a program to convert the temperature from C to F



        B.
            (Gas Mileage) Drivers are concerned with the mileage obtained by their 
            automobiles. One driver has kept track of several tankfuls of gasoline
             by recording miles driven and gallons used for each tankful. 
            Develop a program that will input the miles driven and gallons used 
            for each tankful. The program should calculate and display the miles 
            per gallon obtained for each tankful. After processing all input 
            information, the program should calculate and print the combined miles
            per gallon obtained for all tankfuls. Here is a sample input/output dialog: 

            EX:
                Enter the gallons used (-1 to end): 12.8
                Enter the miles driven: 287
                The miles/gallon for this tank was 22.421875
                Enter the gallons used (-1 to end): 10.3
                Enter the miles driven: 200
                The miles/gallon for this tank was 19.417475
                Enter the gallons used (-1 to end): 5
                Enter the miles driven: 120
                The miles/gallon for this tank was 24.000000

                Enter the gallons used (-1 to end): -1
                The overall average miles/gallon was 21.601423


        C.  (Sales Commission Calculator) One large chemical company pays its salespeople on a commission basis.
             The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For
            example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of chemicals in a week receives $200 plus 9% of
            $5000, or a total of $650. Develop a program that will input each salesperson’s gross sales for last
            week and will calculate and display that salesperson’s earnings. Process one salesperson's figures at a
            time. Here is a sample input/output dialog:

            EX: 
                Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 5000.00
                Salary is: $650.00
                Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 1234.56
                Salary is: $311.11
                Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): -1

        D. A company pays its workers in the following conditions:
                a. The worker gets 5$/h if he works for 200h 
                b. Every extra hours over 200h is payed double
            Given the amount of hours the worker works calculate his wage.

        E. Make a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.
