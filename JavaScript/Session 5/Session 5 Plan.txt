Functions in depth


0. Function What Why and How?

    What:   Function are a number of instructions grouped under a name to solve 1 and only 1 task
    Why:    Not to repeat ourself(code), to make the code more readable
    How:    
            Definition:     function nameOfFunction (parameterList){
                                //Body
                            }   
            Calling:        nameOfFunction(argList);

1. Functions dos and donts
    DOs
        a.  The Function should do one thing and one thing ONLY
        b.   Names of the functions must be verbs, as functions are actions
        c.  The function name should discribe in detail what the function does
        d.  The Function should be 20 lines-long at max

    DONTs
        a.   DONT Write a function that has more than 3 parameters
        b.   DONT write a function that has more than 30 lines 
    
    HOW: 
            1.  Solve the problem by not following the rules above
            2.  Refactor the code to follow the rules above   

2. The return keyword

3. Why are functions the second most important thing in programming?

4. Function call
    Calling a function?
    How do the arguments work?(passing by value and reference)
    
5. Calling yourself...  
        How does the Stack of function-calling work?
6.  Recursive vs Iteractive
