React
    What?
        React is JS library that helps to build SPA

        What is a SPA and how does it work?
            SPA, single page app
            The page will load once and then everything
            will be taken from the server as chunks of HTML,CSS and JS
    Why?
        Better development process
        Better user experince
        We can use other libraries with React to make our job easier
            Compontent libraries(Material UI)
            State Managment libraries(Redux)
        We can use React as part of our project
    How?
        We import the React library
            CDN - content dilivery network
            NPM - node package manager(You have to have nodeJs installed)
        Create our own HTML TAGS
        Compontents === new TAGS

Javascript and React
    React is just a couple of functions that mostly deal with keeping the state in sync the UI 
    React makes our Code Reusable

Before using React
    reactjs.org is your best friend

Using React (reactjs.org)
        With CDN(importing it from the web)
        Downloading it to our project
            Using React for partial parts of the project
            Building everything using React
Using JSX


    Template expression
        Only one top-level element
        class -> className
    Variables
        ${logo} -> {logo}
        {2===3 ? "True" : "False"}
        {name.toUpperCase()}
        href = {url}
    Events
        onClick={printEventInfo}                when having no arguments to take
        onClick={(e) => printEventInfo(e)}      when having some arguments to take
