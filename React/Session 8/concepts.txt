Fetching data
    1. Export the logic of fetching data in a costum hook
        Because we repeat the code for fetching data in many Components
    2. Make sure to return data, isLoading, error
    
Display the palceholders
    1. Get "isLoading" from the useFetch hook
    2. Use this varaible to display palceholders or not 
    3. It`s better to have a seperate component for the palceholder
            EX: Card -> CardPlaceholder
        However you can use the same component with a little bit of a tweek

RECAP: 
        How do components pass data between each other

        1. Data Prop
                Parent -> Child (data props)            The parent wants to change the state of the child
        2. Function Prop
                Child -> Parent (function props)        The child wants to change the state of the parent  

NEW:
        3. Template props
                Parent -> Child (template props)        When the parent want to change the innerHTML of the child
                    by using the "children" prop, which is reserved for the template prop only

Rules of Thumb:
    0. Make it work then refactor you code following the steps below

    1. If you repeat the code at the state area(first part) of a component 
            => export the logic into a custom hook
    2. If you repeat yourself at the template area(second part[after return])
            => export the html into a custom component
