4. Units in depth
    a. Fixed Units      (width of icons, border-radius, border-width)
        px, cm, mm
        
    b. Relative Units   (width of elements, margin, padding)    

        rem     -> font-size of root element(<html>)  (16px by default)  10rem => 10x16px = 160px
        em      -> reltaive to the font-size of the element             

        vw      -> relative to the view-port(screen) width
        vh      -> relative to the view-port(screen) height

        %       -> relative to width of the parent element

        c. Publish Repo (after Login)
        d. Initialize the main branch

    Adding Features
        a. Have a feature in your mind that you want to implement
        b. Create a new branch for this feature  (Locally)
        c. Publish the branch in the github repo (Remotlly)

        e. Test the feature
        f. Commit the changes   (Locally)

Shifting from larger to smaller screens:
    a. Design by keeping in mind how are you going to display your content in smaller screens
    b. SHIFT THE DIRECTION OF THE CONATINERS ROW->COLUMN
    c. HIDE SOME ELEMENTS IN SMALLER SCREENS (navbar/sidebar)
        show a button to pop these elements/containers up
    d. Keep you width, font-size, margin and padding defined by the RELATIVE UNITS

Shifting from non-responsive to responsive Design
    a. check all your widths and make sure they are set with relative units of mesaurment
    b. check the font-size, set all of them with "rem"
    c. check all the margin and padding, set all of them with "em"
