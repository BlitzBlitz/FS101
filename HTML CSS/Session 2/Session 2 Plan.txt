Positioning 
    1. Go to the container of the element 
    2. I display the container as flex
    3. I use justify-content for positioning elements left-right
    4. I use align-items for positioning elements up-down
What happens when I use flex
    1. Every element becomes an inline element
    (it will occupy only the width of the content)
        justify-content: flex-start;
    2. The hight of every element becomes as the height of the container    
        align-items: stretch;
    3. Every element is aligned in row
        flex-direction: row

How does the development of a website works?
    1. Dividing the template into containers
    2. Creating the html doc by putting all the containers and elements
    3. Styling the html
