            Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now
            went rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost
            perpetually reigns.

            For sleeping man, ’twas hard to choose between such winsome days and
            such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning
            weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward
            world. Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still
            mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the
            clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle
            agencies, more and more they wrought on texture.

            It was so; only that now, of late, he seemed so much to live in the
            open air, that truly speaking, his visits were more to the cabin,
            than from the cabin to the planks. “It feels like going down into
            one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to himself—”for an old captain like me
            to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug berth.”

            It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over
            with large blackish looking squares.

            Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now
            went rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost
            perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the
            Tropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,
            redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped
            up—flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights
            seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely
            pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden
            helmeted suns!
