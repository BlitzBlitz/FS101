                        EX: SELECT * FROM users;

CRUD:               CREATE
                        CREATE DATABASE db_name
                        CREATE TABLE table_name
                        INSERT INTO table_name VALUES()
                    
                    READ
                        SHOW databases
                        USE databas_name
                        
                        SELECT colums FROM tabel_name;
                        SELECT * FROM posts LIMIT 3 OFFSET 4;

                        SELECT * FROM posts WHERE column=value
                        SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id IN(1,2,4);
                        SELECT * FROM posts WHERE post_desc LIKE '%can%';
                    
                    UPDATE

                    DELETE
                        DELETE FROM posts WHERE id = 3;
                        DROP TABLE table_name;
